Garage Conversion From houzz.co.uk
A double garage is usually around 300 square feet and therefore offers more conversion options. A single garage is the ideal space to create a small room for your home, from an extra bedroom or downstairs bathroom, through to a single bedroom, utility room, home office or playroom. Often garages can be fairly narrow in space and were never functional to use for a car but instead as storage. From handy home offices to extra bedrooms, chic cocktail lounges and even movie theatres, the possibilities are endless.
