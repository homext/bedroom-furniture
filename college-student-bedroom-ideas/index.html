That one little area becomes a kitchen, a bedroom, a dressing area, a gym, a study space and more — and you probably have to share it. Adding a gorgeous headboard to your assigned bed frame will totally transform the overall aesthetic of your room. Modern kids room design and teenage bedroom decor with a studying area can look like a small office, offering a beautiful, bright and functional, small space with a student desk, storage shelves and a chair.
