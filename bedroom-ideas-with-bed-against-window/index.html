Window seat ideas in the bedroom are useful for more than just relaxing, they can also be used for extra storage and even sitting to put on your shoes. For the drapery, i went with inexpensive ikea ritva curtains in a very pretty woven cotton (it’s hard to beat $15/panel) and hung them on a black cast iron french rod. Another thing to consider is that its much better to have a solid wall directly behind the headboard rather than a window if possible. A curvy headboard can work wonders when you’re placing a bed in front of a single window instead of a bank.
